# Getting Started
Please see <a href=''> the adversarial data programming website page</a> to make yourself comfortable with the adversarial data programming concept. Here, we will do the following:
1. Model a basic generative adversarial network with linear layers
2. We will formalise our Labeling Functions Block using a labeling function based on Kmeans clustering
3. We will train the model end-to-end on MNIST dataset
# Installation
You need to install:
1. Pytorch > 1.2+
2. Python 3.6+
3. matplotlib
4. torchvision
5. install kmeans of pytorch using the command `pip install kmeans-pytorch'
